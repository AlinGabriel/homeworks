# Homeworks

These are homework assignments from various software
courses during the time I was a student at the
Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science,
from the University Politehnica of Bucharest in Romania.

The implementations found here can be used as a point of reference
when developing any software of your own or homework. 

Current students are welcomed to inspire from them,
but still I advise them not to copy whole pieces of code,
as the point of them is to understand basic concepts,
not to mention that course instructors will use plagiarism detection tools.
I will not be made responsible if you get caught. 

Also, homeworks should not be the same each year. Course instructors 
should change homeworks every year.
