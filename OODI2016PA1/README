Simple Java Drawing Application using AWT and Swing.
It can draw rectangles and circles of
three colors: red, green and blue. It also shows the
current date.
 
When the exit button is clicked, the GUI
serializes the figures and content of the text area
to disk in a file named "figures",
basically saving the current state of the drawings.

When the GUI is started, it will check for the existence
of the "figures" file and if exists, opens it and populates
the figures and the corresponding content in the text area,
deserializing any saved figures and redrawing them.
 
The "X" Close Button was created intentionally to not
save any contents. For this purpose exists the
"Exit" button.
