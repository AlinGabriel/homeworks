These are homework assignments from various software
courses during the time I was a student at the
Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science,
from the University Politehnica of Bucharest in Romania.

Current students are welcomed to inspire from them,
but still I advise them not to copy whole pieces of code,
as course assistants will use plagiarism detection tools.
