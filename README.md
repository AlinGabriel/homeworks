These are homework assignments from various software
courses during the time I was a student at the
Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science,
at the University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania.

Current students are welcomed to inspire from them,
but still I want to warn them to do not plagiriaze the
code, as course assistants have tools for plagiarism detection.
