# Homeworks

These are assignments from various courses during the time I was a 
student at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science,
from the University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania.

The implementations found here can be used as reference
when developing any software of your own or homework. 

Students are welcomed to inspire from them, still I advise 
them not to copy whole pieces of code, as the point is to understand 
basic concepts, not to mention course instructors will use 
plagiarism detection tools.
I will not be made responsible if you get caught.

Also, assignments should not be the same each year. 
Course instructors must change homeworks now and then.
Technologies are constantly evolving and so should the courses.
